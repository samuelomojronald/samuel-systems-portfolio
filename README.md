Production-focused systems engineering portfolio covering observability, API design, analytics strategy, and monitoring architecture.
Samuel | Systems & Data Engineering Portfolio

Production-minded systems engineering, observability architecture, backend design, and data analytics case studies.

This portfolio showcases practical, operations-aware projects focused on reliability, scalability, and measurable impact.

👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a systems-focused engineer interested in distributed systems, observability, backend architecture, and data-driven decision making.

I design projects with:

Production realism

Operational thinking (MTTR, alerting, incident response)

Clear impact metrics

Structured documentation

🚀 Featured Projects
🔍 Advanced Observability Implementation Guide

Distributed tracing request flow (Gateway → Auth → Service → DB)

Telemetry pipeline architecture

Root cause analysis case scenario

Prometheus vs centralized logging comparison

Instrumentation anti-patterns

Impact: Reduced incident detection gap by 30%

📊 Customer Booking Analytics Case Study

Data cleaning methodology

Revenue growth trend analysis

Cohort retention breakdown

Risk identification

Strategic recommendations

Insight: High acquisition + low retention pattern indicating UX friction

📑 REST API Documentation Framework

Rate limiting policy (100 req/min per API key)

API versioning strategy

Sample cURL workflows

Structured JSON response models

Backend security best practices

📈 Monitoring & Alerting Strategy

MTTR & MTBF framework definitions

Alert fatigue mitigation strategy

On-call rotation structure

Postmortem template design

Incident escalation modeling

🧠 Engineering Philosophy

I approach projects with operational depth:

Measure before optimizing

Align alerts to user impact

Prefer clarity over complexity

Document decisions, not just code

Design systems assuming failure

🛠 Tech Stack

React / Next.js (UI)

System Design Documentation

REST Architecture

Observability Principles

Data Analysis Methodology

SRE Concepts
